Hello ‚úåÔ∏è My name is Florent HAFFNER.

I am a PhD student in digital signal and image processing. I work at [IFP Energies nouvelles](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/) and study at [CentraleSupelec | Universit√© de Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) ü§ì

I use GitHub mainly as a home to link and manage my information system. Most of my repositories are private, so there's no glitter, but I can tell you that they are minimalist. Also, since I tasted AWS+DevOps culture for 2 years, I want to keep things as simple and efficient as possible. 

Maybe I'll host other projects here again if there's a need to make them public (probably because of a research paper).
