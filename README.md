Hello ✌️ My name is Florent HAFFNER.

I am a PhD student in Digital Signal and Image Processing. I'm working at [IFP Energies nouvelles](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/) 🤓

I use GitHub mainly as a home for linking and managing my information system, so most of my repositories are private. 
However, I will publicly host my paper-related research projects.
